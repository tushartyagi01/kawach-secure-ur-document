# 🚀 Kawach

Kawach is a MERN stack app designed to provide secure and private document sharing, ensuring that your sensitive data remains safe from misuse.

The Problem:
Imagine you’re a customer who needs to share a document — let’s say a contract or personal identification — with a cafe owner, or any other business, for a service. In a typical scenario, the cafe owner might save your document on their computer or device, and over time, they could sell or misuse your private information for personal gain.

Once your document is saved on their system, there’s a risk that it could be shared, copied, or resold without your knowledge. Even worse, if they sell your document to a third party, you might never know where your private data ends up or how it’s being used.
